## 个人介绍

React was originally created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke). Today, React has a [dedicated full-time team working on it](/community/meet-the-team), as well as over a thousand [open source contributors](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/AUTHORS). We'd like to recognize a few people who have made significant contributions to React and its documentation in the past and have helped maintain them over the years:

- [Almero Steyn](https://github.com/AlmeroSteyn)
- [Andreas Svensson](https://github.com/syranide)

This list is not exhaustive.

We'd like to give special thanks to [Tom Occhino](https://github.com/tomocchino) and [Adam Wolff](https://github.com/wolffiex) for their guidance and support over the years. We are also thankful to all the volunteers who [translated React into other languages](https://translations.reactjs.org/).
